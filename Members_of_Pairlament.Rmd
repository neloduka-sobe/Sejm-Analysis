# Background of the data

This data has been downloaded from [API of Polish Parliament](https://api.sejm.gov.pl/), to analyze the general statistics considering Polish MPs, and to give an insights on political processes of the Polish political body.

# Description of the Data

## Members of Parliament

```{R}
datatable(mp, filter = "top")
```

**`active`**: Determines if MP is an active MP

**`birthDate`**: Date of birth

**`birthLocation`**: Location of birth

**`club`**: Club membership

**`districtName`**: Name of the district of the MP

**`districtNum`**: Number of the district of the MP

**`educationLevel`**: Education level of the MP

**`email`**: E-mail to the MP

**`firstLastName`**: First and last name of the MP

**`firstName`**: First name of the MP

**`id`**: Id of the MP

**`lastFirstName`**: Last and first name of the MP

**`lastName`**: Last name of the MP

**`numberOfVotes`**: Number of votes for the MP

**`profession`**: Profession of the MP

**`secondName`**: Second name

**`voivodeship`**: Voivodeship of the MP

**`inactiveCause`**: The cause why MP is inactive (if inactive)

**`waiverDesc`**: Description of the cause why MP is inactive (if inactive)

## Clubs

```{R}
kable(clubs)
```

**`email`**: E-mail of the club

**`fax`**: Fax of the club

**`id`**: Id of the club

**`membersCount`**: Number of members

**`name`**: Name of the club

**`phone`**: Phone number of the club

# Cleaning the Data

We would drop phone, email, and fax of the club, as it is data, we don't need for the statistical analysis

```{R}
clubs <- clubs %>%
  select(id, membersCount, name)
```

We would also drop `firstLastName`, and `lastFirstName`, as those are redundant in respect to `firstName`, `secondName`, and `lastName`

```{R}
mp <- mp %>%
  select(!c(firstLastName, lastFirstName))
```

We also change `birthDate` to the date type

```{R}
mp <- mp %>%
  mutate(birthDate = as_date(birthDate))
```

# Translating the data

#TODO

# What is the club distribution in the parliament?

```{R}
club_distribution <- mp %>% group_by(club) %>%
  summarise(number_of_members = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(number_of_members))
kable(club_distribution)
```

As we can see from the table the biggest club in the parliament right now is PiS with 192 MPs.

# What is the distribution of the MPs per voivodeships?

```{R}
voivodeship_distribution <- mp %>%
  group_by(voivodeship, club) %>%
  summarise(number_of_members = n()) %>%
  arrange(voivodeship, desc(number_of_members))

per_voivodeship <- voivodeship_distribution %>%
  group_by(voivodeship) %>%
  summarise(number_of_members = sum(number_of_members))

ggplot(per_voivodeship, aes(x="", y=number_of_members, fill=voivodeship)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity") + coord_polar("y")
```

# What is the distribution of the MPs per voivodeship with regard to the club?

```{R}
ggplot(voivodeship_distribution, aes(fill=club, y=number_of_members, x=club)) +
  geom_bar(position="dodge", stat="identity") +
  scale_x_discrete(labels = NULL, breaks = NULL) +
  labs(x = NULL) +
  facet_wrap(~voivodeship)
```

# How does the distribution of education level of the Polish MPs look like?

```{R}
ggplot(mp, aes(x=educationLevel)) +
  geom_bar()
```

# How does the distribution of professions of the Polish MPs look like?

```{R}
professions <- mp %>%
  group_by(profession) %>%
  summarize(number = n()) %>%
  filter(!is.na(profession)) %>%
  arrange(desc(number))
datatable(professions, filter = "top")

p <- professions %>% filter(number > 1)
ggplot(p, aes(x=profession, y=number)) +
  geom_segment(aes(x=profession, xend=profession, y=0, yend=number)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8, angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

# Are there any inactive MP? What are the causes of it?

```{R}
not_active <- mp %>% filter(!active) %>%
  select(firstName, secondName, lastName, club, inactiveCause, waiverDesc)
kable(not_active)
```

# Visualization of number of votes per MP using treemap

```{R, out.width="100%"}
treemap <- mp %>% mutate(secondName = ifelse(is.na(secondName), "", secondName))
ggplot(treemap, aes(area=numberOfVotes, fill=club, 
               label=paste(firstName, secondName, lastName), subgroup=club)) + 
  geom_treemap() +
  geom_treemap_subgroup_border() +
  geom_treemap_text(min.size=1) +
  theme_void()
```

## What is the distribution of number of votes per club?

```{R}
ggplot(mp, aes(x=club, y=numberOfVotes, fill=club)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(legend.position="none")
```

# Visualization using map for districts of MPs

```{R}
# Use API to get coordinates
# Mutate dataset
# Use ggplot for plotting the data
# TODO

# Visualisation using calendar for birthdays

```{R, out.width="100%"}
# https://r-charts.com/evolution/calendar-heatmap/
birthdays_per_day <- mp %>%
  group_by(month = month(birthDate), day = day(birthDate)) %>%

birthdays_per_day <- birthdays_per_day %>% mutate(date = as.Date(paste("2024", month, day, sep="-"))) %>% mutate(yday = yday(date))

all_days_df <- data.frame(yday = 1:366)
merged_df <- merge(all_days_df, birthdays_per_day, by = "yday", all.x = TRUE)
merged_df$number[is.na(merged_df$number)] <- 0

calendR(year = 2024,
        special.days = merged_df$number,
        gradient = TRUE,

# Introducing Voting Data

The Polish Parliament API provides the data on all the voting, including the votes of a single MP. It provides a great opportunity to statistically analyze, and visualize the processes behind most important decisions in Poland.

# Loading the Data

```{R}
# Two votings types: Yes/No; on list
votings_path <- "./Data/votings/"

# Yes/No votings
y_n_votings <- read.csv(paste0(votings_path, "y_n_votings.csv"))

# On List votings #TODO
on_list_voting_files <- list.files(votings_path, pattern = "sitting")

for (i in on_list_voting_files) {
  temp <- read.csv(paste0(votings_path, i))
  rm(temp)
}
```

# Cleaning the data

We are dropping yes column, as it contains number of yes `votes`, `votes.firstName`, `votes.lastName`, `votes.secondName`, `votes.club`, `term`, `notParticipating`, `totalVoted`, and `no` as those data is redundant or is not relevant. We would also drop `kind` as it has `R length(unique(y_n_votings$kind))` unique value.

```{R}
# Yes/No votings
y_n_votings <- y_n_votings %>%
  select(
    !(c(yes,
    notParticipating,
    votes.firstName,
    votes.lastName,
    votes.secondName,
    votes.club,
    term,
    totalVoted,
    no,
    kind)))
```

# Description of the Data

The dataset after cleaning has the following columns:

```{R}
names(y_n_votings)
```

`abstain`: 1 if MP abstained during voting, 0 otherwise

`date`: Date of the voting

`sitting`: Number of sitting

`sittingDay`: Day of the sitting

`title`: Title of the voting

`votes.MP`: ID of the MP

`votes.vote`: Vote of the MP

`votingNumber`: Number of voting

`topic`: Topic of the voting

`description`: Description of the voting

Sessions of Polish Parliament are divided into points, and votings. In this data, `title` column regards the point of the session, when `topis`, and `description` regard voting.

# Translating the data

#TODO

# Number of votings per sitting, with days distinction

```{R}
votings_per_sitting <- y_n_votings %>% group_by(sitting, day = sittingDay) %>% summarize(number_of_votings = max(votingNumber))
ggplot(votings_per_sitting, aes(x=day, y=number_of_votings)) + geom_violin()
```

```{R}
#voting
#ggplot(votings_per_sitting, aes(x=sitting, ))

# Votings heatmap on calendar

votings_per_day <- y_n_votings %>%
  group_by(date) %>%
  summarize(number = max(votingNumber))

all_days_df <- data.frame(yday = 1:367)
merged_df <- merge(all_days_df, votings_per_day, by = "yday", all.x = TRUE)
merged_df <- merged_df %>%
  mutate(yday = ifelse(yday <= 317, yday, yday-317))
merged_df$number[is.na(merged_df$number)] <- 0

calendR(year = 2024,
        special.days = merged_df$number,
        from=as.Date("2023-11-13"),
        to=as.Date("2024-11-13"),
        gradient = TRUE,
        low.col = "#FCFFDD",
        special.col = "#00AAAE",
        legend.pos = "bottom",
        day.size=3.5,
        title.size = 0,
        weeknames.size=2)
```

# Voting heatmap days and time

```{R}
```

# Percentage of abstained votes heatmap per club

```{R}
#abstained_clubs <- y_n_votings %>% group_by(club) %>% summarize(sum(abstain))
#abstained_clubs
```

# Most abstaining MPs

```{R}
## Strange abstain number when not abstain == 1
#abstaining <- y_n_votings %>%
#  filter(abstain != 1) %>%
#  group_by(votes.MP) %>%
#  summarize(abstained = count(abstain == 1), total = n()) %>%
#  mutate(id = votes.MP)

#abstaining <- inner_join(mp, abstaining, by = c("id"), na_ma) %>%
#  select(c(id, club, firstName, secondName, lastName, abstained, total)) %>%
#  arrange(desc(abstained))

#datatable(abstaining, filter = "top")
```

# Least voting MPs

```{R}
```

# Deeper statistical analysis of the data (correlations, predicting votes, importancy of a single MP)
